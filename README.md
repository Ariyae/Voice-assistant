# Voice-assistant
This is my voice-assistant. Her name is Chinki. She is designed in Python 3.9.0
Before using the code the user needs to have the foloowing libraries

import subprocess
import wolframalpha
import pyttsx3
import speech_recognition as sr
import datetime
import wikipedia
import pyaudio
import webbrowser

Note: Some of them comes pre-installed with Python but I would recommend you to mention it.
